== Spring HATEOAS
If you develop a RESTful API that makes use of hypermedia, Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring HATEOAS that works well with most applications.
The auto-configuration replaces the need to use `@EnableHypermediaSupport` and registers a number of beans to ease building hypermedia-based applications, including a `LinkDiscoverers` (for client side support) and an `ObjectMapper` configured to correctly marshal responses into the desired representation.
The `ObjectMapper` is customized by setting the various `spring.jackson.*` properties or, if one exists, by a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` bean.

You can take control of Spring HATEOAS's configuration by using `@EnableHypermediaSupport`.
Note that doing so disables the `ObjectMapper` customization described earlier.

NOTE: Spring Boot only supports Spring HATEOAS with Spring MVC.
Adding Spring HATEOAS to a Spring Boot application with Spring WebFlux can cause the application to fail.
